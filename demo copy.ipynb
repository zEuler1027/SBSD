    "# 1. Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We are leveraging a score-based Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) diffusion generative model to achieve stable molecular conformation generation. The project uses the QM9 dataset, which includes 100,000 stable molecular conformations, represented by atomic numbers and Cartesian coordinates. Our approach focuses on the Variance Exploding Stochastic Differential Equation (VE-SDE) for model training, combined with the trainable equivariant graph neural network PaiNN to predict reverse SDE scores effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training process spans a total of 8 hours over 500 epochs on a single RTX 4090 GPU, ensuring a robust and efficient model. After completing the training, we employ the Euler-Maruyama method for reverse inference, facilitating the generation of molecular conformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our method can generate stable conformations for given molecular compositions, demonstrating significant stability and chemical relevance. To verify the chemical validity of the generated molecules, we use the open-source library Open Babel to convert the generated structures into SMILES notation. This process confirms that the majority of the generated molecules are both stable and chemically meaningful, showcasing the potential of our approach in practical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, our project successfully integrates advanced deep generative model with molecular science, providing a powerful tool for generating and analyzing stable molecular conformations with high accuracy and efficiency."

    "Diffusion model is a kind of generative model, which has gained extensive attention in generating high-quality samples in recent years.  They use the principle of diffusion process to generate complex data distribution from simple noise distribution by way of gradual de-noising. Diffusion generative models can be primarily divided into three categories: Score Matching with Langevin Dynamics (SMLD), Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), and Score-based Generative Model (SGM). Here, we primarily use SGM, precisely VESDE."

    "### *Variance Exploding Stochastic Differential Equation (VESDE) Diffusion*\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance Exploding Stochastic Differential Equations (VESDE) diffusion models are a class of score-based generative models. These models leverage the principles of stochastic processes, particularly stochastic differential equations (SDEs), to model the evolution of data points over continuous time. (Song, Yang, et al. \"Score-based generative modeling through stochastic differential equations.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2011.13456 (2020).)\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Core Concept*\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of VESDE diffusion is the idea of modeling the data distribution as a process that evolves over time according to a stochastic differential equation. This evolution is characterized by the variance of the data points increasing (or \"exploding\") as time progresses, which is a key feature distinguishing VESDE from other types of SDE-based models like Variance Preserving SDE (VPSDE).\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Mathematical Formulation*\n",
    "\n",
    "The VESDE can be defined by the following SDE:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$dx_{t} = f(x_t, t)dt + g(t)dW_t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x_t$ represents the data point at time $t$\n",
    "- $f(x_t, t)$ is the drift term that dictates the deterministic part of the evolution.\n",
    "- $g(t)$ is the diffusion term that controls the magnitude of the stochastic component.\n",
    "- $W_t$ is a standard Wiener process (also known as Brownian motion).\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Training and Sampling*\n",
    "\n",
    "Training a VESDE model involves learning to reverse this diffusion process. During training, the model is trained to denoise corrupted data samples, effectively learning the reverse dynamics of the SDE. This reverse process can be described by the reverse-time SDE, which can be solved using techniques like the Euler-Maruyama method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once trained, sampling from a VESDE model involves simulating the reverse-time SDE starting from a noise distribution (typically Gaussian noise) and evolving it backward in time to obtain a sample from the learned data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Molecule Generation*\n",
    "\n",
    "The coordinate space of the molecule is a continuous space, so we want to use the diffusion model to generate the three-dimensional conformation of the molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the main code for the socre-based model:"

This property is especially useful when dealing with tasks with spatial symmetries (such as molecular modeling, physical simulations, etc.), as it guarantees that the model is invariant or isotropic to these transformations and is able to better capture and exploit the symmetries in the data.\n",
